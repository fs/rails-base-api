This simple application includes ruby/rails technology which we use at FlatStack for new REST API projects.

Application currently based on Rails 4 stable branch and Ruby 2.2

## API

Status of the API could be checked at [http://localhost:5000/docs](http://localhost:5000/docs)

### Initializes

* `01_config.rb` - shortcut for getting application config with `app_config`
* `mailer.rb` - setup default hosts for mailer from configuration
* `requires.rb` - automatically requires everything in lib/ & lib/extensions
* `rack_cors.rb` - setup whitelist of domains to allow cross-origin resource sharing

### Scripts

* `bin/setup` - setup required gems and migrate db if needed
* `bin/quality` - runs rubocop, brakeman, rails_best_practices and bundle-audit for the app
* `bin/ci` - should be used in the CI or locally
* `bin/server` - to run server locally

### Serializers

### PaginatedArraySerializer

Use that serializer if you want to add meta with pagination info on response

```ruby
def index
  respond_with(
    posts,
    serializer: PaginatedArraySerializer
  )
end
```

The above usage of `PaginatedArraySerializer` will produce the following:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "total":46,
      "per_page":2,
      "page":1
    }
  },
  "posts": [
    { "title": "Post 1", "body": "Hello!" },
    { "title": "Post 2", "body": "Goodbye!" }
  ]
}
```

## Quick start

Clone application as new project with original repository named "rails-base-api"

```bash
git clone git://github.com/fs/rails-base-api.git --origin rails-base-api [MY-NEW-PROJECT]
```

Create your new repo on GitHub and push master into it.
Make sure master branch is tracking origin repo.

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:[MY-GITHUB-ACCOUNT]/[MY-NEW-PROJECT].git
git push -u origin master
```

Run bootstrap script

```bash
bin/bootstrap
```

Make sure all test are green

```bash
bin/ci
```

Run app

```bash
bin/server
```

**Do not forget to update this file!**

```bash
mv doc/README_TEMPLATE.md README.md
# update README.md
git commit -am "Update README.md"
```

### Restrict access to documentation

You can enable restrict access to documentation by adding `APITOME_USER` and `APITOME_PASSWORD` environment variables. Can be useful on staging environment.
